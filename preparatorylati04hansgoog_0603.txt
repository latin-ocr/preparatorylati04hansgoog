ΕΡ. 111. 1. A0U.c.m coss. “The consuls ofthis year-2&
were M. Pupius Piso and M. Messala3 the first of whom, as soon aa
he entered into office, put a slight affront upon Cicer-03 for his
opinion having been asked always the first by the late consula, Piso
called upon him only the second, on Catulus the third, Hortensius the
fourth. This, he says, did not displease him, since it lest. him more
at liberty in his voting, and -freed him from the obligation of any
complaisance to a man whom he despised. This consul was warmly
in the interest of Clodius: not so much out of friendship‚ as a
natural inclination to the worst side; for, according to Cicero'e ac·
count of him, he was a man ⁸ of a weak and wicked mind ς achurlish,
captione sneerer, without any turn of wit, and making men laugh by
hia looks rather than by his jesoe; savoring neither the popular nor
aristocratical party3 from whom no good was to be expected, because
he wished none, nor hurt to be feared, because he durst do none;
who would have been {nore vicious, by having one viee the lesa,
eloth aad lazineoe,’ Sto. Cicero frankly used the liberty which thio
consul's behavior allowed, of delivering his sentimenta without any
reserve3 giving Piso himself no quat-ter, but exposing everything
that he did and said in favor of Clodius, in such a manner as to hindei·
the senate from decreeing to him the province of Syria, which had
been designed, and, in a manner, promised to him. The other consul,
Mesala, was of a quite different character: a firm and excellent
magar-ate, in the true interesta of hia country, and a constant ad·
mirer and imitator of Cicer-02⁹
