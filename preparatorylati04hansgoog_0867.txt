causan i. e. both were partisans of Pompey. — 5. Quasi sig-
num . . . . sustulisti. A military metaphor‚ perhaps intended

nendum, quod erat insiqne, quum ad arma concurri oporteret ’² (Caesar,
B. G. 11. 20). — 6. omnibus ‚- by all-2 sc. intellectum est. H.
388, Π. A. a S. 225, 11. Klotz ‘has in omnibus, and Baiter, who
