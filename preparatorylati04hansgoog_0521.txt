und the names of the leading eonspirators wem know-n, not only ιο the
angien-ame, bnt to the public st large, yet there was no legal evidence
against any individui. The favori-able moment, however, at iength arrived.
Cet-tuin Allobrogian deputies were in Rome at this time, secking the re-
dms of certain grimaneus of ‘their lintion. Lentulus, thinking that he
eould make these availuble for his own purposes, made known the plot to
elim, nnd tried ιο induce them to eo-opemte with him by stimulating their
eonati-ymen to insui-menon. At first they listened somewhnt Pavombly to
δ’· plan but nster edculnting und bslsncing the chauces, they resolved to
neure a eet-tuin end immediate recompenso, rather than to speculato upon
doubtful end distant advantsges. Accordingly they revcnled all to Q.
Fabius Sanga, the patron of their state, who in his turn acquainvcd cicero,
nd, by the instructions of the latter, enjoined the ambassadors ιο effect
guent zenl in the undertaking, and, if possible, ιο get ,possession of some
ungible documenta-y pmof. They succeeded in doing this. A writ'ten
agreement, signed by Lentulus, Cethegus, and Statilius, was placed in theii-
hnnds‚ und having quitted Rome soon after midnight on the ad of Decem-
ber, ueeompmied by Τ. Volturcius, who was charged with despatches‘for
offiano, they vste all attested, while crossing the Milvian bridge, by two

cioem having been infor-med of the success of his plan, euriy in tho

pumenee, who, ss they suspected nothing of what was going on, cume with.
οιι hesitation. He dien assembled the senate in the temple of concord,
*himer the secund together with Volturcium and the Allobroges wem eon·
ducted sor an examination. The whole plot having been thus discovered, ’
and the guilt of Lentulus, Cethegus, and seven others established beyond a
doubt, Lentulus, who was praetor, was forced to abdicate his office, und
then along with the rest was consigned to the charge of certain individuale
os high station who became responsible for their appearance. Immediately
dher the adjonrnment of the senate, Cicero gave a detailed account of the
whole affair to the people in the following speech.
