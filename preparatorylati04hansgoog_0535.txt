ANALYSIS.

Cn. 1. By way of introduction, Cicero expressos his gratitudo for the
kind feeling which they had manifested towards him, enumeratos some of
the perils to which ho had exposed himself for their safety and that of tho
Roman peoplc, declares his willingness to incur theno perus still, provided
be ωε] thereby rescae his country fmm min, bnt

Cn. 11. Entreats them, without regan-<1 to his own safcty, to consider
only tho welfum of tho stato. At tho samo timo ho testifica his anxicty for
his mor-strichen family, and, on this account, again urges tho senato to
um themselves for the ssfoty of tho mpublic. He calls attention to tho
mlty md enormity of tho crime of which tho prisonem

Cu. 111. Wc'rc guilty, to tho clearuess with which their guila had been
eut-blished, aud to tho several dccroos which had boen passed by tho sonato
tt their previous mcctiug, and urges tho importancc of specdy action.

Cu. IV. The two obinions which have thus far been given, that of D.
Silanus, who was in favor of immediato death, and that of C. Caesar, who
>ms in favor of imprisonmont for life, are stated, and the arguments by
which they wem supported aro briofly revicwcd.

Cn. V. It might be for his personal interest for the senato to adopt tho
opinion of Cacsar, since hc might bo shielded by tho popular favor which
he (Caesar) enjoycd from popular violcnoe; novet-tholosa ho would have
than take that course which tho intemat- of tho state demanded, iri-espec·
tivo os all privato considerations. Finally ho states Cassan-'s opinion that
thecompimors wore excludcd stom the henofits of tho semproniani law,
uinco, having become cnemies to tho state, they hod forfeioed all tho privi-
hgoe of citizens.

Cu. vl. Is they should follow tho opinion of Silanus, they could
easily clear themselves of the charge of cruelty, for there could be no cm-
elty' m punishing ι crime of such magnitude. This proposition is illus-

numanam and axamplc.
