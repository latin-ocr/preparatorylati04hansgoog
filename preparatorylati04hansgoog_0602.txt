282 genoe arose from some of the conspiratura themseva who communi·
cated to him, from time ιο time, the designs of their associates, hs
was obliged to conceal the authors of these,discoveries; and, therefore,
in laying his allegatione before the senate or people‚ he was under
the necessity of speaking only in general tex-ms, and'of assuring them
that he had been infhrmed of the particular articles he mentioned.
But though the event proved that his informatione were true, yet, in
general, this method of accusation was extremely odious. Cicero's
enemies, therefore, did not fail ιο take advantage of this popular ob-
jection, and were perpetually repeating the phrase, 1 am informati,
whenever they were disposed to reproach his conduct in this trans-
action.

the preceding sentence. Pompey had declared his intention of very*
strenuously insisting that Antonius should be recalled from his gor·
ernment, in order, ιο give an account of his administration 3 which‚it
seems, had been extremely oppressive. It was upon this occasion
that Cicero promised him his services. The motion to recall, how·
ever, was either not carried, or was ἀπορροάς for two years asten-this,
it appears by a letter to Atticus, he was still in his government. But
in the consulate of Julius Caesar, B. C. 59, he was amigned sor his
ill-conduct in Macedonia, 'and as being concerned iia Catiline’s oon·
spiracy. The latter article of the impeachment could not be proved.
though the truth of it was generally believed; but he was convictui
of the former, and condemned to perpetual banishment. Cicero. on
this occasion, appeared as his advocate, and thus kept the word which
he had given in this letter.
