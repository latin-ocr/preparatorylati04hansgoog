·1. lmperatorfl. The title os Imperator, in the times of the re·
public, was very different from the meaning it afterwards obtained.
After a victory it was usual for the soldiers to salute their commender
as imperator, but it is not correct to suppose that the acclamations of
the army either consen-ed or confirmed the title. It belonged of right
to any oue who possessed the imperium, which was the power of mil-
itm-y command (not to be' exercised within the city walls) solemnly
confirmed by a lex curiata, and authorizing him to vage war in the
name of the senate and people of Rome. Dict. Gr. and Rom. Antiq„
Art, Imperium.
