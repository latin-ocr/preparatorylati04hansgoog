Cn. xlx. 1. Bono — animo ιε with a good intention.

2. Dolor! suo — their own indignation. Dolor ia a general
term designating every painful, oppreeaive feeling. The context
must determine the particular feeling meant. Here it seems to de-
note the feeling of indignation afising from the wrong-s and indignitie
