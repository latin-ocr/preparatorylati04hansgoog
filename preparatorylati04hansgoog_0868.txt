of the emotions of the mind. ⁶⁴ Patricius proposed ‘eos ' (a- talo,
such) in place of et os, and Fae‘rnus and Abrami did the same, pn·-
haps independently3 Patricius asks what os can mean after he h·

between mentem sensusque eos and what follows-'⁹ Long. Et os is

nulla. A good deal has been written on this pamage. Baiter
must have misunderstood the sense when he omitted nuda. Klotz
maintains nulla, and explains it correctly. Cicero says, “ This is ιο
great that no time will destroy thy trophies and memorials3 for them
is no work of man's hands which age will not destroy,— but this act
of thy justice and mercy will daily flourish more.” Undoubtedly
the writer meant to say this, but whether he has said it well is another
matter. The whole chapter is a poor piece of rhetoric. Klotz pre·
