believed that no inconsiderable advantage may bederived from
consulting two so different in many respects as are these, which
could not be gained from the use of one. They will be found
constantly to explain and illustrate each other,- and thus, by
throwing light upon the classic page, to afford both teacher and
pupil that kind of help which· they most need.

The introduction of symnyms, to any considerable extent,
into a work so elementary as this, is a feature almost, if not -
wholly new; and it is hoped that it may not prove unacceptable
to those of my fellow-teachers especially, who are engaged in
preparing young men for college. The practice of discrimi-
nating between words whose general meanings arc the same, or
similar, cannot fail to have a most salutary influence upon men-
tal development and accurate scholar-ship. N early all of this
portion of the notes has been taken, without material alteration,
from Doderlein’s Hand-Book of Latia Synonyms- Questions
on these extracts have been introduced among the references to
intimate that they should be learned and recited by the pupil ς
and to facilitate reviewing‚ and thereby secure thomughneoe
here, these questions are repeated throughout the work.

In the preparation of the notes, my aim has been to do
neither too much nor too little; to render such assistance, and
such only, as seemed to be necessary to enable the pupil‚ by the
full exercise of his own powers, to master his task. I have not
hesitated to translate where translation was really needed, bnt
have, in' general, relied more upon the various other means of
elucidating the meaning of the text, than upon this. In cases
of a free translation of idiomatic expressions, a strictly liteml,
or more literal translation is usually added„

The vocabulary‚ which has been compiled chiefly from Katt-
schmidt’s Latin Dictionarv. has been prepared with much mm.
