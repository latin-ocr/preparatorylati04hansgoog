789 himself, who had an audience with the dictator on the 231} of Sep·
tember, B. C. 46, for the purpose. Though Caesar did not exptedy
‚ pat-don Ligarius on this occasion, Cicero conjectured that he was well
inclined to do it. Meantime, a public accusation was brought agnina
Ligarius by Q. Aelius Tubero, the son of L. Tubero, whom Ligarius
had united with Varus in preventing' from landing in Africa. He
was accused on account of his conduct in Africa, and hin connection
with the enemies of the dictator. The case was pleaded before
Caesar himself in the forum. Cicero defended Ligarius in the snt-
lowing speech, which was delivered in B. C. 46, and before Caesar
set out to Spain on his last campaign. Ligarius was pardoned, and
like many others he repaid Caesar’s generosity by becoming one d*
his assassins. It was Caesar’s formne to get the victory over all his
enemies, and to perish by the hands of those whom he thought that
he had made his friends. Ligarius himself got his deser-tn for
Appian speaks os two brothers of the name of Ligarius, who pei-'dni
in the promription of the triumvir-s in Β. C. 43, and in the following
chapter he mentions a third Ligarius, who met with the same fate.
Now, as Cicero expressly mentions three brothers of this name (Pru
Lig. 12), Q. Ligarius must have been one of those who were put te
death on this occasion. ⁷
This speech was circulaoed in writing by the copies which Atticu'·
Librarii made of it, and was much admired. It is in iu kind a
perfect composition.
