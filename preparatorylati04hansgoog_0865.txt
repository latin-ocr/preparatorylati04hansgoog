ORATIO PRO M. MARCELLO

IANTRODUOTION.

M. caumes Maecianus, a friend of Cicero, was consul in Β. C.
51, with Servius Sulpicius for his colleague. Cicero tells us that
Marcellus had been Curule Aedile in the same year as P. Clo-
dius, B. C. 563 and that he aided Milo on his trial sor the murder
of P. Clodius. In his consulship Marcellus moved in the senate
that Caesar should be superseded in his government of the Galliae
before the expiration of the time for which the provinces were
given to him. ·

We must be caresul‚ in reading the history of the troubles which
preceded Caesar’s invasion os Italy, to remember that there were
three Marcelli consuls in three successive years: M. Claudius Mar-
cellus in Β. C. 513 C. Claudius Marcellus in B. C. 50, who was the
cousin os M. Marcellus3 and C. Claudius B. C. 49, the brother of
M. Marcellus.

M. Marcellus (Β. C. 51) failed in his attempt to deprive Caesar of
his provinces. In B. C. 50 the attempt was again made, and again
it failed3 but a Senatus Consultum was passed, by which Caesar
was deprived os two legions, on the pretence that they were wanted
sor the Parthian war. Early in B. C. 49, in the consulship of β.
Claudius Marcellus and L. Cornelius Lentulus, Caesar crossed the
Rubicon and occupied Ariminum.
