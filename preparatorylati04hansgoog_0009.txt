year succeeding his consulship and ending with the year of his
death. Resides throwing much light upon the orations and af·
fording to the pupil a pleasing and interesting variety of reading·
matter, these letters reveal more of the heart and true character
of Rome's greatest orator, philosopher, and scholar, than any
n'umber of his orations could possibly do. These letters have
been arranged in chronological order, and there has been pre·
fixed to those of each year a brief history in Latin of the prin-
cipal events of that year. This will aid very much in under·
standing many of the allusions in the text. I hope this slight
departure from the old beaten track may prove acceptable to
both teachers and scholars.

In conclusion, I wish to say that very little is claimed on the
score of originality. Mine h'as been the far humbler task to
condense and arrange the materials which have been produced
by others. I have had constantly before me the various editions
of Caesar, Sallust, and Cicero, which are in common use in th'e
schools of this country, and, in making the notes, have drawn
freely from these and all other sources within my reach what*
ever was suited to my purpose. In many instances credit has
been given3 and it would have been agreeable to my views and
feelings always to do this; but it was in some cases very incon-
venient, and in others quite impossible. A large portion of the
notes on Cicero's letters, and all of the Roman history which is
placed at the beginning of each of the years covered by these
letters, have been taken without much alteration from a selectim
of Cicero’s letters by T. K. Amold, A. M. Besides my ἰῐι-ι
debtedness in general to those who have preceded me in this

department of litet-ary labor, Ι am under special obligations
to the Rev. J. Τ. Champlin‚ D, D., President of Waterville
