of which family Archias also assumed its gentile name Licinius. As ciem

ooeupmions, also engaged at that time in insu-ueting young Romans. Some
years later, he accompanied M. Lucullus on a jouruey to Sicily, und ou
their retum they passed through Heraclea in Lucania. There, too, he* was,
fflough the mediation of LuculluS, honored with the hunchuc-3 und this
m the more valuable to him, as that town was in a nearly equul leg-ul re-
lation to, and alliauee with, Rome, and ns Archias seems to have deter-
mined to spend the remuinder of his life ut Rome. In B. C. 92, the trib-
unes M. Plautius Silvanus and C. Papirius Carbo brought forward a bill
(let Plautia Papiria) by thch the franchise was conferi-ed upon ull those
who wem enrolled us citizens in an allied town, provided they had a domi-
cile in Italy at the time of the passing of the law, aud gave in their nume

gave in his nume for registi-atlon to the praetor Q. Metellus. But in Β. C.

or by cnmity against Lucullus, came foi-ward, asserting that'Archias was a
perquium, and had illegally assumed the name of a Roman citizen. At-
abias was unable to bring sot-ward en‘y evidence of his franchise, for the
archives of Heraclea had been destroyed by fire: during his long stay at-
Rome, mor-cover, he had never entered his name as a citizen in the census

not, indeed, with a striet legul argumentation, for the proofs were wanting,
but he sets up the dignity of the accused, the affection he had met with
