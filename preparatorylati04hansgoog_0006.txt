PREFACE.

 

THE preparation of this volume was commeneed some years
⁸511oe in the belief that the Latin preparatory course for college,
both in the variety and arrangement of the materials composing
'12 &nd in the materials themselves, could be improved ; and that,
by oemprising in a single volume what is usually obtained from
three or four, the expenses of the young student could be very

wnsidembly lessened. A desire to awaken a deeper interes't in
ehssssicul studies as well as to promote thoroughness in their
Damnst, and to eontribute something towards placing the advan-

*λυθῶ of a liberal edueation within the reach of all, is my

⁸P⁰¹⁰gy‚ therefore, for adding another to the already numerous

hst of selmokbooks·

The idea which Ι have endeavored to keep constantly before
Ψ ¹⁵ ΠΝ of a driu-book5 and, in striet acoordance with this
Q nothing has been introduced, whether by way of grammat-
ξω] referenoqss, synonyme, notes, history, or geography, which it
ns not ‹leemed important that the student should make himself
mquainted with.
