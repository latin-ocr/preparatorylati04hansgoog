Er. XXVI. This letter vas written at Brundi-'nm between No-
vember, B. C. 48, and the end of that year. In June, B. C. 49, Cice-
ro embarked at Brundisium for Greece, where he joined the camp
of Pompey. For the space of nearly a year fi-om this time little is
known of his movemente: one or two notes only have been pre-
served, which show that, during his residence in the camp of Pompe5‚
he was in bad heulth, embarrassed by pecuniary difficultiee, in the
habit ofjnveighing against everything he heard and saw aronnd him.
and of giving way to the deepeet despondency. After the battle of
Pharsalia (August 9, Β. C. 48), at which he vas not present, he
returned to Brundisium, where he remained for ten months.

1. ῙΙι maximis nob dotenhus- Dnring the whole of
the time mentioned in the end of the preceding note, ‘⁶ Cicero’s
mind was in a most agitated and unhhppy condition. He vas con-
etantly tormented with unavailing remome on account ef the folly of
lin past conduct in having identified himself with the Pompeiam
when he might have remained unmolested et home; he was filled
with apprehensione as to the manner in which he might be treated by
Caesar, whom he had so osten offended and so lateiy deceived3 he
moreover was visited by secret shame and compunction for having at
once given up his associatos upon the first turn of fortune 3 above all,
he was hauntcd by the foreboding that they might aster all prove vic-
totiens, in which event his fate would have been desperate3 and the
cup of bitterness vas filled by the unnatural treachery of his brother
and nephew‚ who were secking to recommend themselves to those in
power by casting the foulest calumnies and vilest asper-niens upon
their relative, whom they represented as having reduced them stom
their duty.”
