was gradually recovering his strength, Pompey had been engaged in s
short, bnt successful and brilliant war against the pirates ε he had subducti
and pursued them to the remotest corners in the east os the Mediterranea.
When Cicero delivered the present speech Pompey’s campaign against ds
pirates was at an eud, but he still possessed unlimited command of th
fleet and army in all parts of the Mediterranean, and ou all its coasts ω s
considerable distance from the sea. At this juncture of affairs, the tribm
C. Manilius brought fot-ward a bill proposing that the war against Mithri-
dates should be committed to Pompey 3 that he should conduct it with all
the means he still held at his command; and that, accordingly beshoald
be left in possession of his unlimited powers; and, moreover, that the in·
terior of Asia also should be assigned to him as his province. The modu·
ate and truly republican patriota thought that this vas going too far, aad
that it was dangerous to intrust so much power ιο one man. Q. Catulm
and the orator Hortensius, accordingly, opposed the bill of Manilium while
others, aud especially Julius Caesar, either in order ιο establish a pneoedeut.
or to create n reaction against Pompey, by committing so much power ιο
him, spokc in favor of Manilius and Pompcy. cicero himself defended&
Manilian bill with all the influence of his brilliant eloquenee, and induenti
the people unanimously to inti-nst to Pompey the supreme command in
the war against Mithridates.
