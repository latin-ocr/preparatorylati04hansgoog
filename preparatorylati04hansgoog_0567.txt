ing it to a successful termination. He had already taken several
townz, and the remainder, which were besieged, thinking that they
might obtain more favorable terme from Pompey than from Metellus,
nent ambassadors, offen-ing ιο submit to him. Pompey‚ desii-Qus of
appropriat-ing to himself the honors which rightfully belonged ιο Me·
tullus, listened ιο their application and sent two legates into Crete,
enjoining Metellus to take no further steps in the war, and ordei-ing
the cities not ιο obey Metellus, but L. Octavius, one, of the legates,
whom he had sent. Metellus, however, paid no attention ιο Pompey‚

dered ιο him.
